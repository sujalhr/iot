AIM : Write a program to interface LED/Buzzer with Arduino /Raspberry Pi and write a program to ‘turn ON’ LED for 1 sec after every 2 seconds.

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
Void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  PinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
Void loop() {
  DigitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                     // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);  // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(2000);                     // wait for a second
}
